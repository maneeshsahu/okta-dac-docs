# Introduction

The Okta Identity Cloud provides a rich set of APIs and services that can be used to develop custom solutions for SaaS use-cases. We demonstrate these capabilities with [okta-dac](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-dac), a sample application that implements the common use-case(s) of providing delegated administration (aka "self service") capabilities to SaaS tenants.

There are generally 2 approaches when it comes to architecting multitenancy with Okta. The first involves what's known as "hub and spoke" architecture, which requires an Okta Org for each tenant and incurs additional cost and overhead. The second involves only one Org.

This documentation focuses on the second approach. If you're building a multitenant application, read on to decide if the single org architecture is right for you.
